/*
You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies (which is a list of pairs of
projects, where the second project is dependent on the first project). All of a project's dependencies
must be built before the project is. Find a build order that will allow the projects to be built. If there
is no valid build order, return an error.
EXAMPLE
Input:
projects: a, b, c, d, e, f
dependencies: (a, d), (f, b), (b, d), (f, a), (d, c)
Output: f, e, a, b, d, c
