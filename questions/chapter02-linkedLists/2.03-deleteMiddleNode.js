Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but
the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to
that node.
EXAMPLE
lnput:the node c from the linked lista->b->c->d->e->f
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f
